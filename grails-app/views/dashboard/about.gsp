			<h2>THE COMPANY</h2>
			<p>VILLA GAREZA OUTDOOR ADVERTISING is an all – Filipino company organized in April 1989 in response to the growing needs of business communities for varied and sophisticated advertising services. Organized by a group of managers and engineers with extensive manufacturing, fabrications and marketing background, with technical training and management exposure. They came from a prestigious and leading private firm in the same line of business.</p>
			<p>In the initial year of its operations, it was able to generate sales penetrating the industries formerly served by its people in other firms notably the country’s major utility company and government owned corporations</p>
			<h2>ADJUSTMENTS AND DIVERSIFICATION</h2>
			<p>In March 1992, the company expanded and improved its organizational structure by moving towards specialization of its operations. The panaflex division was created to concentrate and to fully serve the nationwide requirements of its prime clients.</p>
			<p>In order to strengthen the organization, another adjustment was made in its organizational structure in the mid-1994. Operating divisions were grouped on the basis of market strength and product concentration. The company now has two major divisions: the plastic and the graphic panaflex division. In support of its operations, the finance administration division was created.</p>
			<p>The company has been engaged in forward sales and in indent sales for certain products, maximizing either one or both sales operations depending on the opportunity presented by a market maintaining flexibility in pricing and enhancing profit generation. In March 1998, the company diversified its operation while maintaining specialization. Another division called the Billboard structural erection and maintenance - group was created to handle and develop existing business relations with prime companies and group of companies in the private sector.</p>
			<p>The division is tasked with serving the commercial and industrial requirements of the market and the atomized production projects of all the industries covered by the different divisions.</p>
			<h2>EXPANSION</h2>
			<p>VILLA GAREZA OUTDOOR ADVERTISING has expanded its operations at the present. It has made an extensive market against its competitor to secure its market positions and aim leadership in the next succeeding years.</p>
			<p>The company has also started to implement its regionalization plant for full market penetration and make itself accessible to its existing and potential markets over the entire country. Regional branch offices will be established in preparation for the demand of its existing and target clients for the following major cities such as; Cebu City, Davao City, and Iloilo City.</p>
			<p>Cebu City Branch office will serve our target and existing clients covering the areas of Cebu mainland and Cebu provinces, Ormoc City, Tacloban City, Bohol (Tagbiliran City), Surigao del Norte and Dumaguete City.</p>
			<p>Davao City Branch office will serve our target and existing client covering the areas of Davao City and Davao provinces, General Santos City, Cotabato City, Marvel, Butuan City, Cagayan de Oro City, Iligan City and Ozamis City.</p>
			<p>Iloilo City Branch office will also serve our prospective and existing clients covering the area of Bacolod City, Iloilo City, Kalibo Aklan and Roxas City.</p>
			<h2>HOW THE COMPANY VIEWS THE FUTURE</h2>
			<p>The company views the future as full of opportunities. It is aware of the potentials of its expanding market and growing trend of production caused by the creation of the outdoor advertising research division in the same year.</p>
			<p>This confidence is based on its extensive market experience, its highly competent management and sales force, its saleable wide range of products and services, established contacts both in public and private sectors and, the fact that it was able to weather the crisis in the past.</p>
			<p>The year 2016 is a pivotal year for the company. Management is seriously assessing its resources and determining its capabilities as part of its strategic plan for 2017. Avenues are being explored to fully maximize these existing resources in order that plans could be drawn up for business expansion in various forms to further improve revenue generation and enhancing profitability.</p>
